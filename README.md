# What does it do?

Serves DNS zone files over [Unicast DNS](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) and
[Multicast DNS](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762) simultaneously.


# How does it do it?

A UDP server built atop [CoreNetworking](http://github.com/keithduncan/CoreNetworking).


# What does it even meme?

Allows you to inject DNS responses into the Bonjour Multicast DNS server on your
local network using a zone file.

Configuration is handled by the `DNS_ZONE_FILE` environment variable. This
should be the path to a single zone file or to a directory of zone files.

The server can then be queried over unicast using [dig](x-man-page://dig) or
multicast using [dns-sd](x-man-page://dns-sd).

If you actually want to run this (why would you want to run this?) I'd recommend
using a [launchd](x-man-page://launchd.plist) job.


# Who even writes a DNS server?

Who doesnâ€™t write a DNS server.
